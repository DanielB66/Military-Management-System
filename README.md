# Java Military Management System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a military management system using Java. It includes various classes to handle different types of military units and personnel, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in Java.

## Features
- Manage different types of military units and personnel.
- Implement functionalities for commanding units and soldiers.
- Use of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to create a flexible and scalable system.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for the military management system.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanielB66/Java-Military-Management-System
   ```
2. Compile the Java files.
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the `MusicPlayerProgram.java` script to see the application in action.
   ```sh
   java MusicPlayerProgram
   ```

## Classes
- **Commander.java:** Represents a commander in the military, inherits from Officer.
- **HQSoldier.java:** Represents a headquarters soldier, inherits from Soldier.
- **MilitaryUnit.java:** Represents a generic military unit, contains methods to add and manage soldiers.
- **MusicPlayer.java:** Represents a music player for entertainment within the system.
- **MusicPlayerProgram.java:** The entry point of the application, demonstrating the use of the music player.
- **Officer.java:** Represents an officer in the military, inherits from Soldier.
- **Soldier.java:** Represents a generic soldier, base class for other types of soldiers.

## Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data within classes and providing public methods to interact with that data.
- **Inheritance:** Creating a hierarchy of classes that inherit properties and methods from base classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using method overriding and interfaces to allow objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface.
- **Abstraction:** Defining abstract classes and methods to provide a template for derived classes.
